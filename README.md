# Cache-Simulator
ONE LEVEL CACHE :

A cache of size S with CL as the number of cache lines and block size B with S, CL, and B are in powers of 2.

TWO LEVEL CACHE : 

The size of the level 1 cache is S/2 and the size of level 2 cache is S. This is also be a standalone cache without the intervention of the main memory.

The following mappings are implemented for searching and loading data into both the types of cache memory :

  1. Direct mapping
  2. Associative memory
  3. n-way set associative memory where n is a power of 2.
